# Univariate Linear Regression
Welcome to my first Project on Linear regression 

This project took 2 hours to complete and team size was 1.
A brief description about this project:
I have performed univariate Linear regression on a food truck dataset to predict the Profits based off the Population.
Following are the steps I have performed to reach an accurate model of prediction. 

Step 01: Importing Libraries and Data analysis

Step 02: Searching for missing values

Step 03: EDA

Step 04: Implementing Cost Function J(theta)

Step 05: Implementing Batch Gradient Descent

Step 06: Visualizing Cost function V/S Number of Iterations

Step 07: Analysing optimum Parameters

Step 08: Predicting for unseen data
